# 10_Support_case_classification
Customer Support Case Type Classification
Project Overview
This project aims to automatically classify customer support cases into three categories: Billing, Technical, and General. By leveraging the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML), we build a model that can classify incoming support messages based on their content. The classification process uses Multinomial Naive Bayes with TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization for feature extraction.

The project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to customer service automation, reducing manual effort in categorizing support requests and improving operational efficiency.

Project Objective
The main goal of this project is to build a model that can automatically predict the type of a support case from the content of the support message. This is crucial for businesses that handle large volumes of customer support requests. The model can categorize the support case and route it to the appropriate department or team, improving customer experience and operational workflows.

The Three Case Types:
Billing: Issues related to payments, charges, invoices, subscriptions, etc.

Technical: Issues related to software, hardware, app crashes, login problems, etc.

General: Other types of queries, such as questions about services, settings, or general support information.

Features
Text Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps, such as missing value handling, categorical encoding, and text vectorization using TF-IDF.

Machine Learning Pipeline: The project utilizes a robust Pipeline structure to combine text vectorization (TF-IDF) and the classifier (Naive Bayes).

Model Training: The classifier is trained on historical support case data.

Evaluation: Performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Real-Time Prediction: The user can input new support case messages, and the model will predict its case type.

Confusion Matrix Visualization: A heatmap of the confusion matrix is generated to help interpret the model’s predictions and errors.

Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Additionally, you will need to install the dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file.

You can install them by running:

nginx
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, you can manually install the required libraries:

nginx
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a CSV file containing customer support cases. Each case has the following columns:

case_type: The type of the support case, which can be one of the following:

billing

technical

general

case_description: The description of the support case provided by the customer. This column contains free-text data about the issue the customer is facing.

Example of the dataset format:


case_type	case_description
billing	"I was charged twice for my subscription."
technical	"The app crashes when I try to log in."
general	"How can I update my account details?"
If you don't have a dataset, you can generate your own, but ensure that it follows this structure for compatibility with the code.

Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/support-case-classification.git
Navigate into the project directory:

arduino
Copy
Edit
cd support-case-classification
2. Install Dependencies
Install the required libraries using pip:

nginx
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Or, if you're installing manually:

nginx
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
3. Prepare the Dataset
Ensure that the support_cases.csv file is placed in the project directory. This file should contain historical customer support cases along with their associated types (billing, technical, general).

4. Running the Model
Once everything is set up, run the main script:

nginx
Copy
Edit
python classify_cases.py
This script will:

Load the dataset.

Preprocess the text data.

Train the Naive Bayes classifier.

Evaluate the model using standard classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

Visualize the confusion matrix using a heatmap.

Allow you to input support messages for real-time classification.

5. Sample Usage
After running the script, you will be prompted to enter a support case message, and the model will predict the category of the case:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
Enter a support message (or type 'exit' to quit): "Why was I charged twice on my card?"
The case type is likely: billing
You can input as many support cases as you'd like. To exit the program, simply type exit.

6. Viewing the Results
The script will print the evaluation metrics after training the model. It will also generate a confusion matrix heatmap that visualizes the performance of the classifier.

Additionally, a confusion matrix heatmap will be displayed showing the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

Model Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the model is evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: The percentage of correctly classified instances out of the total instances.

Precision: The proportion of positive cases predicted correctly by the model out of all predicted positive cases.

Recall: The proportion of actual positive cases that were correctly predicted.

F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.

Confusion Matrix: This matrix is visualized using a heatmap to show the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives for each case type.

How the Model Works
Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Data: If there are missing values in the dataset, they will be imputed (for numerical values, using the mean, and for categorical values, using the mode).

Text Preprocessing: The case descriptions are processed using TF-IDF Vectorization, which converts the text into numerical features that can be fed into the machine learning model.

Train-Test Split: The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

Machine Learning Model
The project uses Multinomial Naive Bayes, a popular algorithm for text classification tasks. It works well with text data as it calculates the probabilities of each case type given the word frequencies in the support case descriptions.

Evaluation
Once the model is trained, its performance is evaluated on the test set using the above metrics. The model’s effectiveness is displayed in the confusion matrix and classification report.

Future Work
Improving Model Performance: Experiment with more advanced models like Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, or Deep Learning techniques to improve classification accuracy.

Handling Imbalanced Data: If the dataset is imbalanced (e.g., more billing cases than general), consider using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or class weights to handle the imbalance.

Deploying the Model: You could deploy this classifier as a web application using frameworks like Flask or Streamlit, enabling businesses to classify customer support cases in real-time.

Data Augmentation: Add more variations of support case descriptions to further train the model for better generalization.
